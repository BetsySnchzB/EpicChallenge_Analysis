\cf0 SLIDE 1 - Intro\
\
SLIDE 2\
\'96 Project Overview (3 Phases / Modernization)\
\'93Miami-Dade already operates the 10th-largest transit system in the United States, serving around\
300,000 riders a day. As more people relocate here and Miami leans into its role as a rising tech and\
innovation hub, riders expect public transportation that keeps up: seamless, connected, and easy to use.\
To move toward that reality, the County is upgrading its infrastructure and technology. DTPW is rolling\
out a three-phase fare modernization program to shift the network to a digital, unified system and data\
hub.\
Phase 1 focuses on the new MetroExpress Bus Rapid Transit, or BRT.\
Phase 2 extends the new fare technology to the Metrobus fleet of roughly 1,000 vehicles.\
Phase 3 fully integrates Metrorail into the new payment system.\
Together, these three phases create a single fare platform across BRT, Metrobus, and Metrorail, and lay\
the groundwork for a tap-and-go, account-based system that can expand to other local infrastructure in\
the future.\'94\

SLIDE 3 \'96 BRT Location (Map / Corridor)\
MetroExpress, Miami-Dade County\'92s first-ever Bus Rapid Transit system and the longest all-electric BRT\
service in the nation.\
It runs along a 20-mile corridor on the South Dade TransitWay (parallel to US-1) from Florida City up to\
Dadeland South Station, connecting all of South Dade to the Metrorail system, and ties into existing\
Metrobus routes and park-and-ride lots along the way.\

\f1 \uc0\u11835 
\f0 \
SLIDE 4 \'96 What Makes MetroExpress Different (Corridor + Stations)\
What really makes MetroExpress different from a regular bus route is both the corridor design and the\
stations which help it feel more like a rail line than a traditional bus route.\
Using the TransitWay instead of mixing with regular traffic, BRT utilizes smart signals with give priority at\
intersections, especially during peak hours. At crossings, gate arms and warning lights operate\
automatically to protect the BRT lane and keep everyone safe.\
\

\f1 \uc0\u11835 
\f0 \
Slide 5 \'96 Phase 1 Underway (Launch + Equipment)\
Phase 1 is officially underway as of the October 27th launch of MetroExpress! Riders can now access 14\
new stations along the TransitWay, most with free parking, and all of them offer secure bike storage, air-\
conditioned waiting areas, free Wi-Fi, and charging stations.\
In each station are two Genfare ticket vending machines (TVMs) and two fare gates.\

\f1 \uc0\u11835 
\f0 \
SLIDE 6 \'96 Data Source (Launch Data)\
For this project, we focused on launch-period data from the Genfare system.\
We used ticket sales from the BRT ticket vending machines and redemptions at the station gates,\
covering the first eleven days of service, from October 27th through November 7th, 2025.\
From this dataset, we looked at four main questions:\
\'96 Where and when riders are buying,\
\'96 How they pay\'97cash versus card,\
\'96 Whether those tickets are actually used at the gates,\
\'96 And what early patterns we see by station.\

\f1 \uc0\u11835 
\f0 \
SLIDE 7 \'96 Objective (Challenge vs Solution)\
DTPW shared with us that they have a lot of raw data - transactions from the new Genfare system, sales\
from their legacy fare collection system, and data tied to the Go Miami-Dade app.\
The challenge is that these live in separate systems, and there isn\'92t a single visual view of what\'92s\
happening. Staff often have to pull new Excel files and build charts when a question or meeting comes\
up, and there wasn\'92t yet a routine way to monitor this new BRT launch data. That makes it harder to\
quickly and clearly brief senior leadership.\
Our goal in this micro-internship was to start prototyping the internal \'91canned report\'92 they described.\
Using the MetroExpress launch data, we built a first version of a shared dataset and a core set of visuals\
that could be stitched into a dashboard. This prototype is a starting point that can be refined with\
\
feedback from DTPW about which metrics they most need to see at a glance. The next steps are to\
connect to live data and develop a one stop tool that can be resided in internal meetings as well as\
incorporated into the public application for riders.\
\
4. Graphs (each slide)\
Group graphs into themes (Payment Type, Ridership, Station Comparison)\
Now I\'92m going to walk you through the key insights we found during the first days of the BRT Metro\
Express rollout. We analyzed payment behavior, station activity, and hourly patterns to understand how\
riders are actually using the new system.\
1. Pie Chart - Cash vs Credit\
To start, this pie chart gives us an overall snapshot of how riders paid for their tickets during the first\
two weeks. About 69% of all tickets were purchased using cash, while only 31% were made with credit\
or debit cards.\
This tells us something very important: even though the new BRT system supports digital and\
contactless payments, riders still rely on physical cash. So before we go into station-level data, the big\
picture is already clear, cash is dominating the system.\
2. Tickets Sold by Location &amp; Payment Type\
Next, when we break down ticket sales by station and payment type, the trend becomes even clearer.\
Here we\'92re looking at each BRT station, and the bars show how many tickets were purchased in cash\
versus credit.\
A few things stand out immediately:\
\uc0\u9679  First, four stations lead the entire system: 312th/Campbell, 200th/Caribbean, Allapattah, and\
Civic.\
These are high-volume touchpoints and key areas for improving the rider experience and\
promoting digital payments.\
\uc0\u9679  Second, at almost every station, cash usage is significantly higher.\
The green bars dominate the chart, showing how strong the dependence on cash still is.\
\
\uc0\u9679  Third, some stations rely almost entirely on cash, like Coral Reef, Campbell, Howard, and\
Avocado. These stations would benefit the most from targeted messaging, on-site support, and\
incentives to try digital payment methods.\
\
Overall, this chart reveals a very early but very consistent pattern: a few stations account for most of the\
ridership, and cash is consistently the primary payment method across the whole corridor.\
3. Ticket Count by Location (Map Visualization)\
This map shows where the most tickets were sold across the 14 new BRT stations.\
We can see that 312th/Campbell had the highest activity with 473 tickets sold, followed by\
200th/Caribbean with 406. Then we have Civic with 355, and 112th/Allapattah with 345.\
The main takeaway is that the southern stations, especially around Homestead drive the most ridership,\
while mid-corridor stations remain consistently active. This helps identify which locations need the most\
support, where TVMs are used the most, and where digital-payment adoption efforts would have the\
biggest impact.\
From an operational standpoint, this insight helps identify where TVM demand is highest.\
\
4. Sales by Hour\
Finally, this chart shows how sales change throughout the day. Ticket sales start near zero overnight,\
then rise sharply around 4 AM, and peak between 6 and 7 AM, right at the start of the morning\
commute. After that, sales gradually decrease through mid-morning, then we see a smaller bump\
around lunchtime, between 11 AM and 1 PM.\
There\'92s another increase around 4 PM, which aligns with the evening commute, and after 6 PM sales\
drop again and stay low for the rest of the night. This hourly pattern closely reflects rider behavior.\
\
What these insights really give us is a starting point , a baseline that helps us see the system not as it\
was designed, but as people are actually using it. It sets the stage for smarter decisions, better tools, and\
a smoother rider experience as the system continues to evolve.\
5. Recommendations\
\
\'93Our recommendations focus on supporting the goals DTPW shared with us, increasing ridership,\
\
reducing cash dependence, and preparing the system for a fully modern fare environment during Phases\
2 and 3.\'94\
A.Strengthen Digital Adoption / Encourage app usage\
Why: More digital usage = cleaner data, faster boarding, lower costs.\
How:\
\uc0\u9679  Build on existing Metro Express outreach by adding station-level \'93How to Tap &amp; Ride\'94 panels focused on\
BRT payment flows.\
\uc0\u9679  Use the GO Miami-Dade Transit app more actively for alerts + balance reminders + gentle nudges to\
enable auto-reload.\
\uc0\u9679  Place QR codes at high-cash stations that open the app download or \'93how to pay\'94 page directly.\
\uc0\u9679  Use Spanish &amp; Creole in targeted digital campaigns (social, push, SMS) at the stations where those\
languages are most common.\
\
Benefits:\
\uc0\u9679  Digital = reduced cash handling, better data, and better passenger flow.\
\uc0\u9679  Improves data quality for planning\
\uc0\u9679  Speeds up fare collection and reduces TVM load\
\
Based on these patterns we\'92re seeing , especially the heavy dependence on cash, our first\
recommendation is to strengthen digital adoption, particularly through the GO Miami-Dade Transit app.\
More digital usage means faster boarding, cleaner data, and a lower operational load overall.\
One of the easiest ways to support this shift is through clearer guidance at the stations themselves.\
Adding simple, visible \'91How to Tap &amp; Ride\'92 panels can help riders understand exactly how to use\
contactless payments. We also suggest using the app more proactively for things like balance reminders,\
subtle nudges to enable auto-reload, or quick alerts when a rider is close to earning fare capping. All of\
these help make digital payment feel easier than cash.\
Another opportunity is at the high-cash stations we identified. Placing QR codes that open the app\
download page or a quick \'91how to pay\'92 tutorial gives riders immediate access to digital tools. And\
because many of these stations serve diverse communities, expanding Spanish and Creole digital\
messaging can make the experience more inclusive and more effective.\
Altogether, these steps help shift more riders into EasyCard and contactless methods, reducing cash\
handling and improving passenger flow.\
\
B - Expand Digital Payment Incentives\
\
Why: Riders switch behavior faster when there\'92s a clear, visible benefit.\
\
How:\
\uc0\u9679  Make 1-Day Fare Capping front-and-center in Metro Express and future campaigns (simple examples:\
\'93After 4 taps, the rest of the day is free\'94).\
\uc0\u9679  Run time-limited \'93digital first\'94 pilots at a few stations (e.g., \'93tap with card/phone this week = automatic\
discount on your 5th trip\'94).\
\uc0\u9679  Highlight \'93tap &amp; go\'94 savings and time-savings on station screens, bus interior screens, and social media.\
\uc0\u9679  Explore EasyCard reload bonuses with local retailers / community partners as part of those pilots.\
\
Benefits:\
\'95Drives faster adoption of contactless &amp; EasyCard.\
\'95Increases rider satisfaction (\'93best fare automatically\'94).\
\'95Supports the long-term shift from cash to account-based.\
Our second recommendation is to expand digital-payment incentives. Riders adopt new behaviors much\
faster when the benefit is clear and easy to understand.\
Fare capping is a perfect example. Making it more visible through something as simple as messaging like\
\'91After four taps, the rest of the day is free\'92, helps riders immediately see the value of switching from\
cash to digital. We also suggest running short digital-first pilots at a few key stations to encourage riders\
to try contactless payment at least once. Highlighting tap-and-go convenience on station screens and on\
buses reinforces that digital is not only cheaper but also faster. And finally, working with local retailers\
or community partners to offer small EasyCard reload bonuses during these pilots can help build\
momentum. These kinds of clear, targeted incentives can spark that initial shift in behavior, increase\
rider satisfaction, and support the long-term transition away from cash.\
\'93Miami is already investing in contactless and fare capping. Our suggestion is not to add a completely\
new product, but to use short, targeted incentives to get more riders to try digital at least once, and to\
communicate the value of fare capping in really simple language, especially at stations where cash is still\
very common.\'94\
\
C - Improve Visibility Through Advertising\
Why it matters:\
\'95 Riders adopt new habits only when messaging is clear and repeated\
What to do:\
\'95 Launch a unified \'93Tap. Ride. Go.\'94 campaign across BRT, Metrobus &amp; future rail\
\'95 Reuse Metro Express visuals + add simple micro-instructions (\'93Tap here\'94, \'93Best fare with\
tapping\'94)\
\'95 Add short explainer clips on bus &amp; station screens\
\'95 Tie accessibility &amp; safety benefits back to the core action: tap to ride\
Benefits:\
\'95 Helps shift public perception of transit\
\'95 Brings new riders\
\'95 Positions DTPW as modern + unified\
\
\'93D-T-P-W already has great marketing around Metro Express. Our recommendation is to use the next\
wave of advertising to focus even more on the payment behavior you want, tapping with a card, phone,\
or EasyCard.\
If riders see the same icons, the same instructions, and the same look across BRT, regular buses, and\
eventually rail, it becomes much easier for people to know exactly what to do, no matter where they\
ride.\'94\
\
D - Launch/ Structure Rider Surveys\
Why it matters:\
\'95 Direct feedback explains why riders still use cash\
What to do:\
\'95 Convert current QR/email feedback into a short, standardized payment survey\
\
\'95 Offer small incentives (free ride, EasyCard points, monthly raffle)\
\'95 Target high-cash stations, riders with TVM issues, and new Metro Express users\
\'95 Combine survey responses with transaction + TVM data\
Benefits:\
\'95 Reveals the reasons behind cash usage\
\'95 Guides equipment &amp; service improvements\
\'95 Adds new variables for analysis\
\
\'93Right now riders can send feedback, but it\'92s very open-ended. We recommend turning that into a short,\
structured survey, especially at the high-cash stations.\
That would give D-T-P-W clear, measurable reasons behind why riders choose cash, what\'92s confusing at the TVMs,\
and where future improvements should be focused.\'94\
\
8. Global Best Practices in modern fare systems\
\
(Intro)\
\'93Before wrapping up, we wanted to briefly highlight what the most successful transit systems\
around the world tend to do when they modernize fare collection. Not to compare cities, but to\
show common patterns, and where Miami is already aligned.\'94\
\
What leading transit systems around the world have in common:\
\uc0\u9679  Account-Based Ticketing (ABT)\
\'93One thing we see everywhere, from London to Singapore, is that modern systems are account-based.\
That means the card or phone isn\'92t carrying the money. It\'92s just an ID that points to a cloud account.\
Miami is moving in this direction with Easy Card + contactless payment, which is great because that\'92s the\
foundation for things like fare capping and mobile integration.\'94\
\
\uc0\u9679  Mobile &amp; Contactless First\
\'93A second big trend is making mobile and contactless taps the default. It\'92s fast, it\'92s convenient, and it\
gives agencies clean data. Miami is already encouraging contactless credit cards and digital payments, so\
that\'92s completely aligned with global best practices.\'94\
\uc0\u9679  Reducing Cash Usage\
\'93Another pattern is gradually reducing cash. Every system we studied moves toward digital first,\
because cash is expensive to manage and provides very limited data. We see Miami doing this already,\
especially with the new TVMs, and that shift will become even more important in Phases 2 and 3.\'94\
\uc0\u9679  Unified Branding / Clear Messaging\
\'93Successful systems make paying extremely simple \'97 one color reader, one set of instructions. Miami has a\
chance to unify payment messaging across all transit services as the system grows.\'94\
\uc0\u9679  Incentives (Fare Capping, Auto-Reload, Loyalty)\
\'93\'93Incentives like fare capping, auto-reload, or loyalty perks help riders switch to digital\
methods. Miami already uses fare capping, which is a great foundation.\'94\
\uc0\u9679  One Ecosystem for All Modes\
\'93Modern systems work the same whether you ride bus, BRT, or rail. Miami\'92s multi-phase\
modernization is moving toward that unified experience.\'94\
\uc0\u9679  Heavy Use of Analytics\
\'93And finally, the most advanced systems use data constantly, not just for ridership, but for planning,\
maintenance, and long-term investment decisions. The dashboard we built for this challenge is a simple\
first step toward visualizing early patterns in the BRT data. As more of the system comes online and\
more data becomes available, DTPW can expand this kind of dashboard into a more powerful internal\
tool.\
\
Closing Sentence\
\'93So overall, Miami is absolutely on the right path, the modernization plan is aligned with what we see\
globally. Our recommendations are simply ways to continue moving in that direction as the system\
grows.\'94\
\
9. Future AI/ML Opportunities for DTPW\
\'93These are examples of the types of models Miami-Dade could use as more data becomes available. Not\
predictions today, but a roadmap of what\'92s possible.\'94\
\
1. Forecasting Ticket Sales\
Models: Linear Regression, ARIMA, Prophet\
Uses: Predict busy days, peak hours, expected cash usage\
Impact: Better staffing, TVM replenishment, and operations planning\
\'93The first opportunity is forecasting. With models like Linear Regression or Prophet, DTPW could predict busy\
days, peak hours, and even expected cash usage. That helps with staffing, TVM replenishment, and planning\
service levels.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0
\cf0 2. Predictive Maintenance for TVMs\
Models: Random Forest, XGBoost\
Uses: Identify which machines fail most, detect card-reader issues early\
Impact: Reduce downtime, fewer lines, faster boarding\
\'93Another opportunity is predictive maintenance for TVMs. Using models like Random Forest, DTPW could\
learn which machines tend to fail, when failures happen, and whether spikes in cash usage point to a card-\
reader issue.\'94\
\
3. Anomaly &amp; Fraud Detection\
Models: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders\
Uses: Flag duplicate order IDs, broken scans, unusual cash spikes\
Impact: Cleaner data, more reliable revenue reporting\
\'93A third opportunity is anomaly detection. Tools like Isolation Forest can spot duplicate order IDs, failed\
scans, or unusual transaction patterns. This helps improve data quality and reduce revenue leakage.\'94\
\
4. Rider Behavior Modeling\
Models: K-Means Clustering\
Uses: Find stations with lowest digital adoption, identify rider groups\
Impact: Target outreach, support digital transition\
\'93We can also learn a lot from clustering, understanding which stations have the lowest digital adoption, or\
which rider groups might switch to mobile payments with the right messaging.\'94\
\
5. \'93What-If\'94 Impact Simulations\
Models: Monte Carlo\
Uses: Predict revenue effects of cash reduction, fare capping changes\
Impact: Test policy options before launching them\
\'93Finally, with Monte Carlo simulations, DTPW could test \'91what-if\'92 scenarios, like what happens to revenue if\
cash usage drops by 20%, or what happens if fare capping expands.\'94}
