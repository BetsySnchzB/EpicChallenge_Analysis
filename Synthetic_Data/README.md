## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Upload `synthetic_brt_data_6months.csv` to Tableau
2. ✅ Use `station_coordinates.csv` for map visualizations
3. ✅ Run `starter_analysis.py` to explore the data
4. ✅ Create your 3 dashboard views following your plan

### For Your Landing Page:
I'll help you add a new "Predictive Analytics" section showing:
- ML model results
- Performance metrics
- Business implications
- Interactive visualizations

### For Interviews:
You can now say:
- "I generated 6 months of realistic transit data modeling payment behavior evolution"
- "My dataset includes 87,000+ transactions with temporal patterns and event impacts"
- "I implemented 5 different ML models for forecasting, classification, and clustering"
- "I created end-to-end analytics from raw data → dashboards → predictive models"

## 💡 Tips for Success

**For Tableau:**
- Use the month-over-month trends to show impact of recommendations
- Highlight Ultra and Art Basel periods as proof of event sensitivity
- Show station-specific digital adoption to demonstrate targeted approach

**For ML Models:**
- Start with simple models (linear regression) before complex ones
- Document your assumptions and methodology
- Show both model performance AND business value

**For Your Portfolio:**
- Emphasize the "complete data science pipeline" story
- Show technical depth (ML) AND business impact (recommendations)
- Your landing page is already professional - just add the ML section!
